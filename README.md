This is a [Next JS](https://nextjs.org) build of my [portfolio site](https://markgreen.io). I've kept the below instructions from the npx create-next-app starter just in case you were interested in using this as a template for your own site. If you do decide to use this repository, please reach out to me and let me know, I would love to hear from you!

## Contact
I can be reached via email at contact@markgreen.io, via my website's [contact form](https://markgreen.io/contact), or via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-green-25b976160/). Have a great day! ðŸ˜Ž

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
