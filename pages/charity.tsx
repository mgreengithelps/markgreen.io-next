              I enjoy volunteering my time to help others succeed. One of the main projects I co-founded and have been a part of over the past few years is <a href="https://fortwaynesoup.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer" className="text-blue hover:text-green transition-colors duration-700 ease-in">Fort Wayne SOUP</a>.

              FW SOUP started with a discussion between myself and a friend on how we could help grow the city of Fort Wayne. My buddy ran across an article about <a href="https://detroitsoup.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer" className="text-blue hover:text-green transition-colors duration-700 ease-in">Detroit SOUP</a>, and as we dug into the idea further, we realized this would be a perfect fit for our city.

            <p className="text-beige max-w-lg mt-6">
              Using the resources available from Detroit SOUP, we scaffolded out what our version of SOUP would look like. I created the branding, logo and website along with marketing materials, and helped wrangle presenters in the beginning. We quickly built a team of volunteers to help us grow the vision into reality.

              Throughout the last 4 years, Fort Wayne SOUP has connected artists, entrepreneurs, established business owners, non-proft leaders, and everyday community members together, and has helped fund over $20,000 for various projects and businesses around the city.
